In this section, we introduce the most central part of Casibase: chat and its management.

## 1. Chat

Once we have configured the store, we can have a dialogue with the AI. This is shown in the image below:

### Web Search

The chat interface includes a web search toggle that enables real-time internet search during conversations. When activated, the AI searches the web for current information and displays both the search results and final response. Search results appear inline with source URLs and timestamps, making it easy to verify information from recent events or data not in the model's training.

Web search is available with OpenAI and Alibaba Cloud model providers. The toggle is automatically disabled when using other providers.

### Message Display

Messages in the chat interface include enhanced display features. OpenAI reasoning models (like o1 and o1-mini) show their internal reasoning process in expandable sections, allowing you to understand how the model arrived at its conclusions. This transparency helps verify the logic behind complex answers and builds trust in AI-generated responses.

## 2. Chats (Chat management)

We can manage our chat sessions from the Chats menu.

This page allows the user to view the information of the created chats, and the user can also click on Edit to view or edit them. They display the following information:

- `Name`: The name of the created chat.
- `Updated time`: The time when the chat is Updated.
- `User`: The user to whom the chat belongs.
- `Client IP`: Client IP of the chat.
