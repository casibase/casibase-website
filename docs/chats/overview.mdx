In this section, we introduce the most central part of Casibase: chat and its management.

## 1. Chat

Once we have configured the store, we can have a dialogue with the AI. This is shown in the image below:

### Web Search

The chat interface includes a web search toggle button that enables real-time internet search during conversations. When activated, the AI can search the web for current information to provide more accurate and up-to-date responses. This is particularly useful for queries about recent events, current data, or information that may not be in the model's training data.

Web search is only available when using compatible model providers. Currently, OpenAI and Alibaba Cloud models support web search functionality. When using other model providers, the web search toggle will be disabled automatically.

### Message Display

Chat messages include enhanced display features:

- **AI Reasoning**: When the AI uses reasoning or calls external tools (such as web search, calculations, or data retrieval), these intermediate steps appear in collapsible cards. Click to expand or collapse the reasoning details to keep the conversation focused on the final responses.
- **Tool Messages**: Tool execution results are displayed with improved styling, making it easier to distinguish between user messages, AI responses, and tool outputs.
- **Theme Integration**: Message cards automatically adapt to light and dark themes for comfortable viewing.

## 2. Chats (Chat management)

We can manage our chat sessions from the Chats menu.

This page allows the user to view the information of the created chats, and the user can also click on Edit to view or edit them. They display the following information:

- `Name`: The name of the created chat.
- `Updated time`: The time when the chat is Updated.
- `User`: The user to whom the chat belongs.
- `Client IP`: Client IP of the chat.
- `Count`: Number of inputs and outputs for this chat.
- `Token count`: The total number of tokens used for this chat.
- `Price`: Total price spent on this chat.
- `Messages`: Showing the content of the chat's message.

- `Category`: Display the Category to which the chat belongs.
