## Overview

In this section, we will show you how to connect your application to Casibase.

Casibase provides two main methods for integrating with your applications:

* `Casibase SDK` - For direct integration with Casibase's API
* `OpenAI API Compatibility` - For connecting existing OpenAI-compatible UIs and clients

## Casibase SDK

What is Casibase SDK?

Casibase SDK provides a programmatic way to interact with Casibase services. It offers a convenient set of APIs that allow developers to manage tasks, knowledge bases, and other features of Casibase directly from their applications.

We recommend using the Casibase SDK for the following reasons:

1. It provides direct access to Casibase-specific functionality
2. It simplifies authentication and configuration
3. It handles error cases and provides a more developer-friendly experience

Currently, Casibase offers a Java SDK, with more language support planned for the future.

## OpenAI API Compatibility

What is OpenAI API Compatibility?

Casibase supports the OpenAI API format, allowing you to connect any OpenAI-compatible chat UI or client application to Casibase. This makes it easy to use popular open-source chat interfaces with Casibase's backend.

We recommend using the OpenAI API compatibility for the following reasons:

1. It allows you to use your preferred chat UI with Casibase
2. It simplifies integration if you're already using OpenAI-compatible tools
3. It provides a standardized way to interact with Casibase's AI capabilities

This approach is particularly useful if you want to quickly integrate Casibase with existing applications that already support the OpenAI API format.
