## Introduction

In Casibase, **Private Cloud Providers** act as a bridge, allowing you to **connect to and manage** various cloud-native resources, such as **Docker** and **Kubernetes (K8s)**, directly from the Casibase interface. Their core objective is to provide a centralized dashboard for monitoring and operating your containerized services, integrating their management seamlessly into your Casibase workflow.

By configuring a provider, you enable Casibase to communicate with your private cloud or on-premises data center. This provides an ideal solution for organizations that want a unified interface to manage both their knowledge base and the infrastructure it runs on, enhancing operational efficiency and control.

Refer to the [Core Concepts](../../basic/core-concepts) section of our previous documentation for more information about providers.

In Casibase, you can add a private cloud provider by following these steps:

## Add a New Private Cloud Provider

Casibase supports several mainstream cloud-native technologies and platforms, including:

- **Docker**: To connect to a Docker host and manage the lifecycle of its containers (e.g., start, stop, view status) directly within Casibase.
- **Kubernetes (K8s)**: To connect to a Kubernetes cluster and manage its resources, such as Pods and Deployments, providing a high-level orchestration view within Casibase.

Now, you can use this private cloud provider to monitor and manage services in your cloud-native environment.

After adding a private cloud provider, you can use Casibase as a control panel to oversee your containerized applications, simplifying management and providing a unified view of your services alongside your knowledge base.
