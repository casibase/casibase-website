## Introduction

Model Providers enable AI capabilities in Casibase by integrating various large language models (LLMs) and AI services. These providers allow you to chat with AI, analyze documents, generate embeddings, and perform other intelligent tasks.

Casibase supports a wide range of model providers, from major cloud services like OpenAI and Azure OpenAI to local and custom model deployments. This flexibility lets you choose the right model for your use case, whether you prioritize performance, cost, privacy, or specific capabilities.

Refer to the [Core Concepts](../../basic/core-concepts) section for more information about providers in general.
