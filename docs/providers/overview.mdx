Casibase is an open source AI knowledge base system designed to provide efficient and flexible knowledge management and dialogue solutions for enterprises. One of its core features is Providers, which allow users to integrate multiple AI models, storage services, and infrastructure management capabilities. These integrations enhance the functionality and performance of the system.

Providers span several categories including AI Providers (Model and Embedding), Storage Providers, Cloud Providers, and Scan Providers, each serving distinct roles in the system. The provider list interface includes filtering capabilities, allowing you to quickly locate providers by category or type through dedicated filter controls.

## 1. Model Providers

Model Providers is a component in Casibase for integrating and managing AI models. It allows users to integrate various pre-trained AI models into the system for smarter knowledge processing and dialogue generation. With Model Provider, users can easily switch between different AI models, choosing the most appropriate model according to specific needs.

Casibase supports a variety of popular AI models, including but not limited to:

## Model Provider Types

+ Hugging Face: e.g. meta-llama/Llama-2-7b, THUDM/chatglm2-6b
+ OpenAI: e.g. gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4, o1
+ Claude: e.g. claude-opus-4-5, claude-sonnet-4, claude-2
+ DeepSeek: e.g. deepseek-chat, deepseek-reasoner
+ Moonshot: e.g. moonshot-v1-128k, kimi-k2-thinking, kimi-latest
+ Ernie: e.g. ERNIE-Bot, ERNIE-Bot-turbo

## 2. Embedding Providers

### Data vectorisation

The main role of Embedding Providers is to transform various types of data (e.g., text, images, etc.) into dense vector representations. This transformation is a key step in data processing and analysis in Casibase, enabling data to be stored, retrieved and analysed in a more efficient manner.

### Knowledge Retrieval

By converting both the data in the knowledge base and the user's query into vectors, Embedding Providers enables the system to perform fast knowledge retrieval based on vector similarity. This greatly improves the efficiency and accuracy of knowledge base retrieval.

### Flexible model support

Embedding Providers support a variety of embedding models, users can choose the most suitable model according to their needs.

## 3. Storage Providers

We can configure the storage providers in Casdoor. and use it in Casibase, which is the component used to manage Casibase data storage and retrieval. It allows users to store data in different storage services and access the data through a unified interface. With Storage Providers, users can flexibly choose storage services to ensure data security and efficient access.
supports two types of storage: Local and Cloud.

## 4. Text-to-Speech Providers

Text-to-Speech (TTS) Providers is a component in Casibase that enables the conversion of text responses into natural-sounding speech. It allows the system to communicate with users through voice synthesis, enhancing the interactive experience of the knowledge base system.

### Provider Support

Currently, Casibase supports Alibaba Cloud's Text-to-Speech service, with various voice options available through the cosyvoice-v1 interface. The system is designed to be extensible, allowing for the integration of additional TTS providers in the future.

## 5. Speech-to-Text Providers

Speech-to-Text (STT) Providers is a component in Casibase that enables the conversion of spoken language into written text. It allows the system to understand and process voice queries, enhancing the interactive experience of the knowledge base system.

### Local

We support uploading files to the local system.

### Cloud

We support AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, MinIO, Alibaba Cloud OSS, Tencent Cloud COS, and we are constantly adding more Cloud storage services.

## 6. Cloud Providers

Cloud Providers enable Casibase to connect to and manage infrastructure across private and public cloud platforms. These providers allow centralized visibility and control of cloud resources.

**Private Cloud Providers** connect to containerized environments like Docker and Kubernetes, enabling container lifecycle management and orchestration directly from Casibase.

**Public Cloud Providers** scan and catalog cloud infrastructure resources across major platforms. They automatically discover virtual machines, storage volumes, network components, and other cloud assets, enriching each with detailed configuration information through multi-level API discovery.

## 7. Scan Providers

Scan Providers perform network discovery, security auditing, and system assessment operations. Casibase integrates specialized scanning tools that analyze infrastructure assets, detect vulnerabilities, and assess system configurations.

**Nmap Scan Provider** conducts network reconnaissance by scanning IP addresses and port ranges. It identifies open ports, running services, service versions, and operating system details. The provider returns structured JSON results showing discovered hosts, accessible services, and potential security concerns.

**OS Patch Provider** evaluates system patch status and identifies missing security updates. It checks installed software versions against known vulnerabilities and recommends necessary patches to maintain system security.

Scan providers work with the Scan object to execute operations against target assets. Results are captured in both raw and structured formats, enabling detailed analysis through the web interface.
