## Introduction

Scan Providers enable automated network discovery, security auditing, and system assessment in Casibase. These providers integrate specialized scanning tools to analyze infrastructure assets and identify security issues.

By configuring scan providers, you can perform network reconnaissance, detect open ports and running services, assess patch status, and identify missing security updates across your infrastructure. The results are captured in both raw and structured formats for detailed analysis.

Refer to the [Core Concepts](../../basic/core-concepts) section of our previous documentation for more information about providers.

## Add a New Scan Provider

Scan providers are used to integrate network and security scanning capabilities into Casibase. You can add them by following these steps:

More information about each scan provider type can be found below:

:::tip

Casibase supports multiple scan provider types:

- **Nmap**: Network discovery and security auditing through port scanning, service detection, and OS fingerprinting
- **OS Patch**: System security assessment by checking for missing patches and available updates

:::

Now you can use scan providers to assess your infrastructure security and maintain visibility into your network assets.

After adding a scan provider, you can create scans to execute network discovery or security assessments against your infrastructure assets, with results stored for historical analysis.
