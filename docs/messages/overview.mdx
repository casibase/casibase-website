In this section, we introduce the functionality of message in Casibase.

## Messages

The messages module manages all the messages in our sessions. Each message displays detailed metadata including creation time, associated chat, parent message references, token usage, pricing information, and the AI model provider that generated the response.

Token usage and pricing are automatically calculated based on the model provider's pricing structure, ensuring accurate cost tracking for each conversation. The model provider field identifies which AI service (OpenAI, Claude, etc.) processed each message, helping you understand usage patterns across different providers.
