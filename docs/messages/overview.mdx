In this section, we introduce the functionality of message in Casibase.

## Messages

The messages module manages all the messages in our sessions. Each message displays detailed metadata including creation time, associated chat, parent message references, token usage, pricing information, and the AI model provider that generated the response.

The model provider field identifies which AI service (OpenAI, Claude, etc.) processed each message. Token costs are automatically calculated and recorded as transactions for billing. Learn more about cost tracking in the [Billing & Usage](/docs/billing/overview) section.
