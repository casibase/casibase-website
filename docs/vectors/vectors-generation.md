The generation of vectors needs to be used in conjunction with stores, which means that you need to configure stores before you can understand vectors.

Vectors are actually the result of embedding, which is the process of converting various types of data, such as text and images, into dense vector representations. This step is essential to facilitate efficient data processing and analysis within Casibase. With embedding, questions in chat and knowledge files in storage will be converted into vectors that will be used in the next step of knowledge search.

## 1. Automatic Vector Generation

When you upload a file to a store, Casibase automatically generates vectors for that file in the background. The system splits the file into chunks using your configured text splitter, then creates embeddings for each chunk. This happens asynchronously, so you can continue working while the vectors are being generated.

You can monitor the progress in the Files page, where each file shows its current status: Pending (waiting to be processed), Processing (currently generating vectors), Finished (vectors ready), or Error (if something went wrong). The page also displays token counts and error messages when issues occur.

## 2. Refresh All Vectors

The Refresh Vectors action is available as a button on each store in the Stores menu. After configuring stores with storage providers, navigate to the `Stores` page to view the file tree for the storage providers.

Clicking the Refresh Vectors button for a store regenerates vectors for all files in that store. This is useful when you change embedding providers or need to rebuild your vector database. The following figure shows the page and the operation.

## 3. Refresh Individual File Vectors

For more granular control, you can regenerate vectors for individual files from the Files page. Each file has a Refresh Vectors button that deletes the old vectors and creates new ones for just that file. This is handy when you update a single document and want to refresh only its embeddings without rebuilding the entire store.

The file status updates in real-time as vectors are regenerated, showing you exactly when the process starts, finishes, or encounters errors.

## 4. View vectors

After that, we can view the specific vectors generated by that storages in the vector menu.

We can see that the files in the stores from the previous step of refreshing vectors have been converted into vectors to display here.

The edit page of my vectors shows specific information such as the name of the store, the name of the embedding model, the name of the file in which the embedding was performed, the file size, the dimension, the vectors data, and so on.
