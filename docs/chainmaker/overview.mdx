ChainMaker is a high-performance, enterprise-grade blockchain platform developed under the leadership of China. It is designed to provide secure, controllable, and scalable blockchain infrastructure for industries such as finance, government, and supply chain. ChainMaker supports multiple consensus mechanisms, smart contracts, privacy protection, and other features, meeting the needs of large-scale commercial applications.
