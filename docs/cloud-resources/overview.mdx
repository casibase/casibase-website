Once you have successfully connected Casibase to your private cloud providers (like Kubernetes), this section will guide you on how to manage the cloud-native resources directly through the Casibase interface.

Casibase utilizes a powerful two-part system for managing deployments:

1. **Templates**: These are the reusable blueprints for your services. You define the base configuration of an application once as a template.
2. **Applications**: These are the live, running instances created from your templates. You can customize each application before deploying it to your cluster.

This approach helps you standardize your infrastructure and streamline the process of launching and managing services. Please proceed to the following sections to learn more about managing templates and applications.
